# TODOS

### The goal:

 The original goal of this project was to make `infinite` todo applications, as a means to develop some cursory knowledge of as many differnt programming languages, paradigms, and patterns as possible. The wind in the ol' sails ain't too strong on this one, though, and other projects have quickly taken priority. I may pick this up again someday. I may also not.
